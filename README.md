# deeplearning and related

In this repository I would like to showcase some of my work related to neural networks and deep learning.

## Overview:
1) [Linear regression from scratch using Gradient Descent (numpy|matplotlib)](http://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/bockjo/deeplearning/blob/master/Gradient_Descent_Regression.ipynb) <a href="url"><img src="https://www.python.org/static/favicon.ico" height="20" width="20" ></a> <br>

2) [MNIST Digit Recognizer (keras)](http://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/bockjo/deeplearning/blob/master/MNIST%20-%20Deep%20Learning.ipynb) <a href="url"><img src="https://www.python.org/static/favicon.ico" height="20" width="20" ></a> <br>

3) [Fully-connected neural network from scratch (numpy)](http://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/bockjo/deeplearning-and-related/blob/master/FCN_numpy.ipynb)

Besides these short showcase projects I also took part in [Kaggle competitions](https://www.kaggle.com/bockjo), where I trained deep neural networks to recognize cats and dogs with 97% accuracy, for instance.
