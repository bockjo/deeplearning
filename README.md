# Deep learning and related projects

In this repo I would like to showcase some of my work related to neural networks and deep learning. Please use the following links to explore my projects:

## Overview:
1) [Fully-connected neural network from scratch (numpy)](http://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/bockjo/deeplearning-and-related/blob/master/FCN_from_scratch_in_numpy.ipynb)

2) [Using Deep Learning to predict Rossmann store sales (pandas|keras|hyperopt)](http://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/bockjo/deeplearning-and-related/blob/master/Entity_Embedding_Model.ipynb)

3) [MNIST Digit Recognizer (keras)](http://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/bockjo/deeplearning-and-related/blob/master/MNIST_and_Deep_Learning.ipynb) <a href="url"><img src="https://www.python.org/static/favicon.ico" height="20" width="20" ></a> <br>

4) [Linear regression from scratch using Gradient Descent (numpy|matplotlib)](http://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/bockjo/deeplearning/blob/master/Gradient_Descent_Regression.ipynb) <a href="url"><img src="https://www.python.org/static/favicon.ico" height="20" width="20" ></a> <br>

Besides these short showcase projects I also took part in [Kaggle competitions](https://www.kaggle.com/bockjo), where I trained deep neural networks to recognize cats and dogs with 97% accuracy, for instance.
